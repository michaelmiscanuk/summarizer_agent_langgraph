        # You'll need to set this in Railway dashboard to your Ollama instance URL
        # Railway doesn't support Ollama natively, so you'll need to:
        # 1. Deploy Ollama separately (e.g., on a different service)
        # 2. Or use Ollama's cloud API
        # 3. Or use a different LLM provider that has HTTP API
